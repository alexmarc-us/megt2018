## Get Inspired!

Since 2012, through the volunteer efforts of Manette neighbors, local edible
gardeners have been opening their gardens and chicken coops to the community.
Since that first Tour, the Manette Neighborhood Coalition has sponsored the
Manette Edible Garden Tour the first Saturday in August in even years. The gardens
feature many techniques for growing fresh food in urban spaces. The Tour is a great
opportunity for Manette residents to get to know neighbors, and for others to get to
know Manette. The gardener’s page will tell you who is on this year’s Tour and a
brief description of each garden. Garden experts such as WSU Master Gardeners and
West Sound Beekeepers are on site to answer questions and share their expertise.
The Tour is a great way to see different techniques in practice.

For a $5 donation, you will receive a map with descriptions of the gardens and
access to the map on this website. You will also receive a button uniquely designed
for each Tour by a local artist.
