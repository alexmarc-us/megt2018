## Get Inspired!

Since 2012, through the volunteer efforts of Manette neighbors, local edible
gardeners have been opening their gardens and chicken coops to the community.
Since that first Tour, the Manette Neighborhood Coalition has sponsored the
Manette Edible Garden Tour the first Saturday in August in even years. The gardens
feature many techniques for growing fresh food in urban spaces. The Tour is a great
opportunity for Manette residents to get to know neighbors, and for others to get to
know Manette. 

## Our Mission

* Promote awareness of the value of growing your own food.
* Encourage the use of sustainable gardening methods.
* Help develop more food-producing gardens in our community.
* Educate and reach out into the community.
* To show what we love about Manette.
